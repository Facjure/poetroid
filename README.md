Poetroid - Prototype
====================

A working prototype of the Poetroid platform to demonstrate how we can, together, curate, discover, retrieve, tag, search, and read poetry on _any_ device with a modern browser.

You can even distribute the "app" as a single file via email or dropbox.

No software to install. No logins. No Amazon. No DRM. No Apple. No Appstore. No apps.

All your poety in your palms.

## Abstract

Thousands of poems live buried in websites. Hundreds of literary magazines archive thousands more that go undiscovered. Humans, even machines, can't find, interact, and discover more poetry in a central library.

To build an open platform for discovering poetry together on the web, we must think like a modern browser:

1. What is the format for writing a poem and its metadata on the browser?
2. How can we build a search engine as an intellgient social server distributed to the browser?
3. How can publishers access and integrate these poems into their apps, books, and magazines?

In other words: **How can editors and poets and typographers collaborate with each other on an open platform to curate, discover, and share a million poems, together?**

## Status & Roadmap

Under Development.
