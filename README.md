# Discover Poetry Together

Curate, collect, and read poems from the public domain. From any device. For free.

## Overview

The poetroid platform consists of three parts: web, engine, and [poems](https://github.com/Facjure/poetroid-public-domain).

You're in the web. It's opensource.

So are poems.

The engine, not opensourced yet, runs on the cloud as a distributed server and is under active development.

It's written in clojure.

This project also includes python/clojure scripts to scrap sites from the public domain

## Status and Roadmap

Prototyping. Currently in *Research & Development*.

The current [site](http://www.poetroid.com) is a static site, with in-built search, hosting 2000 poems. Editors can add, edit, and curate tags and metadata via an inline markdown editor with live-preview. The site automatically updates via a github-hook that routes to [literatti](https://github.com/Facjure/literatte) compiler running on the cloud.

Once the engine is ready for alpha, the _web_ will be rewritten in clojurescript.

## Usage

Built with [Literatti](https://github.com/Facjure/literatte).

## Documentation

Coming soon.

## Contributers

- Priyatam Mudivarti: writer, engineer, and founder of Facjure LLC
- Sreeharsha Mudivarti: musician, engineer, and survivor of a space ship crash.
