Poetroid - Prototype
====================

A prototype of the Poetroid platform: Discover Poetry Together.

## Abstract

Thousands of poems live buried in websites. Hundreds of literary magazines archive thousands more that go undiscovered. Humans--even machines, can't find, discover, or interact with poems in a central library.

An open web platform should talk to a modern browser and a distributed server. In addition, it must ask the following questions:

1. What is the format for writing a poem and its metadata?
2. How do poets search and discover more poems with a unified api?
3. How can text be adapted in response to screen size and resolution on any device?
4. Finally, how do independent publishers consume and curate poems with Poetroid?
5. And more ...

## Status & Roadmap

This is a clientside prototype with 1500, hand-curated poems by poet, [Ata Moharreri](https://twitter.com/AtaMoharreri). It's a static site generated with our toolkit: [Literatte](https://github.com/Facjure/literatte).

For the real platform, a server with 100,000 poems and an elasticsearch engine is being developed in Clojure.
