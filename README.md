# Discover Poetry Together

Thousands of poems live buried in websites. Hundreds of literary magazines archive thousands more that go undiscovered. Humans, even machines, can't find, interact, and discover more poetry in a central library.

Let's build one.

## Overview

Poetroid = search engine + tools for curation + humachine learning

Three parts: web, engine, and data.

1. Web: you're in it.
2. Engine: runs on the cloud as a distributed server.
3. Data: poems; public domain poems are available from [poetrid-public-domain](https://github.com/Facjure/poetroid-public-domain) library.

## Status

Prototyping / R&D.

An [early protoype](http://www.poetroid.com) without the engine.

## Usage

Built with [Literatti](https://github.com/Facjure/literatte).
