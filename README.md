Poetroid - Prototype
====================

A prototype to curate, search, and discover poetry from the public domain.

## Abstract

A million poems live buried in the public domain. Hundreds of literary magazines archive thousands more that go undiscovered. Humansâ€”even machines, can't curate, annotate, and interact with poems in a central library.

Let's build one.

## Usage

This is a prototype written in Python, Javascript, and Bootstrap, compiled statically and linked with an embedded router to search and read 1500 curated poems by poet, [Ata Moharreri](https://twitter.com/AtaMoharreri).

To run, read how compile static sites with [frozen-pile](https://github.com/priyatam/frozen-pie).

## Roadmap

This is just the beginning.

A real publishing [Platform as a Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) with 100,000 poems and more is being developed in Clojure & Clojurescript, _as_ Poetroid.
