Poetroid - Prototype
====================

A prototype to search, navigate, and show hundreds of poems from any modern browser without any server, database, or framework.

It's just a single html page.

## Goal

Without using a cms, epub, pdf, and mobile app frameworks, render hundreds of poems in a single, responsive page. In addition, describe a [common data format](https://github.com/poetroid/zenup), an editorial workflow, and one-click hosting.

## Usage

This is an early prototype written in Python, Javascript, and Bootstrap using our toolkit, [frozen pie](https://github.com/priyatam/frozen-pie). It compiles all poems, analyzes metadata, builds  static routers, adds simple search, and transforms the poems into responsive templates.

All 1500 curated poems were curated by poet, [Ata Moharreri](https://twitter.com/AtaMoharreri).

## Roadmap

This is a prototype only.
