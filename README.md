# Discover Poetry Together

Curate, collect, and read poems from the public domain. From any device. For free.

## Overview

The poetroid platform consists of three parts: web, engine, and [poems](https://github.com/Facjure/poetroid-public-domain).

You're in the web part, and it's hosted on S3. This also includes scripts to scrap sites from the public domain.

The engine, not opensourced yet, runs on the cloud as a distributed server, and is under active development. It's written in Clojure.

## Status and Roadmap

Unstable. Currently in *Research & Development*.

This work is being done in parallel to [literatti](https://github.com/Facjure/literatte) as we curate thousands of poems from the public domain ...

## Documentation

Coming soon.

# Contributers

- Priyatam Mudivarti: writer, engineer, and founder of Facjure LLC
- Sreeharsha Mudivarti: musician, engineer, and survivor of a space ship crash.
