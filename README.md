Poetroid - Prototype
====================

A working prototype of the Poetroid platform to demonstrate how we can, together, curate, discover, tag, collect, and read poetry on _any_ device.

You can also distribute the "app" as a single file through email or a Dropbox. No software to install, no logins, no Amazon or Apple or appstores or apps to download.

All your poety in your palms.

## Abstract

Thousands of poems live buried in websites. Hundreds of literary magazines archive thousands more that go undiscovered. Humans, even machines, can't find, interact, and discover more poetry in a central library.

To build an open web platform for discovering poetry together, we must think like a modern browser:

1. What is the format for writing a poem and its metadata on the browser?
2. How can we build a search engine as an intellgient social server distributed to the browser?
3. How can publishers access and integrate these poems into their apps, books, and magazines from the browser?

In other words, How can editors and poets and typographers collaborate with each other on an open platform to curate, discover, and share a million poems, together?

## Status & Roadmap

Under Development.
