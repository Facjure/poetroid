Poetroid - Prototype
====================

Thousands of poems live buried in websites. Hundreds of literary magazines archive thousands more that go undiscovered. Humans, even machines, can't find, interact, and discover more poetry in a central library.

Let's build one.

## Overview

Poetroid = open data + search engine + editing tools + human learning

A working [protoype](http://www.poetroid.com) with 1500 poems. No server.
