Poetroid - Prototype
====================

A prototype of the Poetroid platform: curate, discover, tag, collect, and read poetry on _any_ device.

## Abstract

Thousands of poems live buried in websites. Hundreds of literary magazines archive thousands more that go undiscovered. Humans--even machines, can't find, discover, or interact with poems in a central library.

To build an open web platform we must think like a modern browser and a distributed server:

1. What is the format for writing a poem and its metadata?
2. How can we build collective intelligence with a search engine and a responsive web?
3. How can publishers access apis to integrate poems into their own collections and chapbooks?

How can editors and poets and typographers collaborate with each other on an open platform to curate, discover, and share a million poems together?

## Status & Roadmap

This is a prototype (no server) only.

A platform with a base of 100,000 poems and an intelligent search engine is being developed in Clojure & Clojurescript.
