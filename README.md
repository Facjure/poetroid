Poetroid - Prototype
====================

A prototype to curate, search, and display poetry from the public domain.

## Abstract

A million poems live buried in the public domain. Hundreds of literary magazines archive thousands more that go undiscovered. Humansâ€”even machines, can't curate, annotate, and interact with poems in a central library.

Let's build one.

## Usage

This is a prototype written in Python, Javascript, and Bootstrap, compiled statically and linked with an embedded router to search and read 1500 curated poems by poet, [Ata Moharreri](https://twitter.com/AtaMoharreri).

Forget epubs format--1500 poems are served in a **single** html file as an "embeddable app".

To run, read how to compile and build static sites and routes with [frozen-pie](https://github.com/priyatam/frozen-pie).

## Roadmap

This is a prototype only; it proves that a common poetry format like [zenup](https://github.com/poetroid/zenup) can serve as a means to curate and render hundreds of poems in a single, responsive page.
