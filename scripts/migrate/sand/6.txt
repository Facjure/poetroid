I WISH to God I never saw you, Mag.
I wish you never quit your job and came along with me.
I wish we never bought a license and a white dress
For you to get married in the day we ran off to a minister
And told him we would love each other and take care of each other
Always and always long as the sun and the rain lasts anywhere.
Yes, Iâ€™m wishing now you lived somewhere away from here
And I was a bum on the bumpers a thousand miles away dead broke.
      I wish the kids had never come
      And rent and coal and clothes to pay for
      And a grocery man calling for cash,
      Every day cash for beans and prunes.
      I wish to God I never saw you, Mag.
      I wish to God the kids had never come.
