# Scripts for Poetroid poems

## Overview

Scripts provide a convenient way to read, evaluate, and print the results of a single, or a directory of poems.

## Usage



## How to run

Scripts require Python 2.7.x and pip to manage dependencies. Detailed installation instructions
are beyond the scope of this document. However if you're a web developer and have a mac, get
[brew](http://brew.sh/), and run `brew install python` and you're ready to go.

If you're on linux you already know what to do.

## Status & Roadmap

Work in progress.
