PASSERS-BY,	
Out of your many faces	
Flash memories to me	
Now at the day end	
Away from the sidewalks	        
Where your shoe soles traveled	
And your voices rose and blent	
To form the cityâ€™s afternoon roar	
Hindering an old silence.	
 
Passers-by,	        
I remember lean ones among you,	
Throats in the clutch of a hope,	
Lips written over with strivings,	
Mouths that kiss only for love.	
Records of great wishes slept with,	        
   Held long	
And prayed and toiled for..	
 
   Yes,	
Written on	
Your mouths	        
And your throats	
I read them	
When you passed by.
