DUST of the feet
And dust of the wheels,
Wagons and people going,
All day feet and wheels.
 
Nowâ€¦
..Only stars and mist
A lonely policeman,
Two cabaret dancers,
Stars and mist again,
No more feet or wheels,
No more dust and wagons.
 
   Voices of dollars
   And drops of blood
    .  .  .  .  .
   Voices of broken hearts,
   ..Voices singing, singing,
   ..Silver voices, singing,
   Softer than the stars,
   Softer than the mist.
