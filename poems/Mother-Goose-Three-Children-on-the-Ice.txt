Three children sliding on the ice
    Upon a summer's day,
As it fell out, they all fell in,
    The rest they ran away.

Oh, had these children been at school,
    Or sliding on dry ground,
Ten thousand pounds to one penny
    They had not then been drowned.

You parents who have children dear,
    And you, too, who have none,
If you would keep them safe abroad
    Pray keep them safe at home.
