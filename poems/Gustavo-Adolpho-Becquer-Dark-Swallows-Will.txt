Dark swallows will hang their nests of your balcony,
And they will knock you on the window playing once again.
But those that refrained their flight,
To gaze at your beauty and my happiness,
Those who learnt our names,
Those will not return any more

Dense honeysuckles will climb the walls of your garden,
And every afternoon they will open their flowers for you once again,
Even lovelier than before.
But the honeysuckles full of rain we used to look together,
And whose drops saw fall and shine as tears of the day,
Those won't return any more.

Burning words of love will play in your ears once again,
And maybe your heart will leave its deep dream at least.
But silent, entranced and on my knees,
As only God can be adored before the altar, as I have loved you
Make no mistake, no one will love you that way!
