The little one sleeps in its cradle,
I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.

The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill, 
I piercingly view from the top. 

The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom, 
It is so… I witnessed the corpse… there the pistol had fallen.
