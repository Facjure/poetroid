Tonight the Moon dreams with increased weariness,
Like a beauty stretched out on a downy heap
Of rugs, while her tired fingers caress
The contour of her breasts, before falling to sleep.

On the satin back of the avalanche soft,
She falls into lingering swoons, as she dies,
While she lifts her eyes to white visions above,
Which like efflorescence float up to the skies.

When at times, in her languor, down on to this sphere,
She slyly lets trickle a furtive tear,
A poet, desiring slumber to shun,

Takes up this pale tear in the palm of his hand
(The colors of which like an opal blend),
And buries it far from the eyes of the sun.
