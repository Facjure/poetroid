     Silently she's combing,
     Combing her long hair
     Silently and graciously,
     With many a pretty air.

     The sun is in the willow leaves
     And on the dapplled grass,
     And still she's combing her long hair
     Before the looking-glass.

     I pray you, cease to comb out,
     Comb out your long hair,
     For I have heard of witchery
     Under a pretty air,

     That makes as one thing to the lover
     Staying and going hence,
     All fair, with many a pretty air
     And many a negligence.
