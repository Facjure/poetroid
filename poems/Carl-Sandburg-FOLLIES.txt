          SHAKEN,
The blossoms of lilac,
     And shattered,
The atoms of purple.
Green dip the leaves,
     Darker the bark,
Longer the shadows.

Sheer lines of poplar
Shimmer with masses of silver
And down in a garden old with years
And broken walls of ruin and story,
Roses rise with red rain-memories.
          May!
     In the open world
The sun comes and finds your face,
     Remembering all.
