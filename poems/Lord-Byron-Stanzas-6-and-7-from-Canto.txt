Most epic poets plunge _"in medias res"_[23]
      (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
    And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
      What went before--by way of episode,
    While seated after dinner at his ease,
      Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
    Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
    Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.

    That is the usual method, but not mine--
      My way is to begin with the beginning;
    The regularity of my design
      Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,
    And therefore I shall open with a line
      (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning),
    Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
    And also of his mother, if you'd rather.
