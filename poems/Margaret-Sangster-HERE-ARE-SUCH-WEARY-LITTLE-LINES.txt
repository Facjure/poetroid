There are such weary little lines about the mouth of you,
Such tragic little mirthless lines—they mock at dreams come true,
And twist your lips when you would smile, until all joy is dead,
And I, who want to laugh with you, am fain to weep instead!

There are such dreary little lines about the mouth of you,
They make me want to whisper that summer sky is blue,
And that the rain is like a lance of silver through the air,
And that the flowers in the lane are growing tall and fair!

There are such tired little lines about the mouth of you—
As if you thought that life was cold and loving friends were few....
They are such lonely little lines I think that I, some day,
Will creep close to you in the dusk, and kiss them quite away!
