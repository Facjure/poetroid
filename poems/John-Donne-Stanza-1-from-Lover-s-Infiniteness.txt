IF yet I have not all thy love,
    Dear, I shall never have it all;
I cannot breathe one other sigh to move,
Nor can entreat one other tear to fall;
And all my treasure, which should purchase thee,
Sighs, tears, and oaths, and letters, I have spent;
  Yet no more can be due to me,
  Than at the bargain made was meant:
If, then, thy gift of love was partial,
That some to me, some should to others fall,
  Dear, I shall never have it all.
