Every kind for itself and its own… for me mine male and female, 
For me all that have been boys and that love women, 
For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted, 
For me the sweetheart and the old maid… for me the mothers and the mothers of mothers, 
For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears, 
For me children and the begetters of children.
