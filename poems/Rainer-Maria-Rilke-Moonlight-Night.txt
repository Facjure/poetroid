South-German night! the ripe moon hangs above
Weaving enchantment over the shadowy lea.
From the old tower the hours fall heavily
Into the dark as though into the seaâ€”
A rustle, a call of night-watch in the grove,
Then for a while void silence fills the air;
And then a violin (from God knows where)
Awakes and slowly sings: Oh Love ... Oh Love ...
