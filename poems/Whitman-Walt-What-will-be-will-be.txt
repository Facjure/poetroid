What will be will be well-- for what is is well, 
To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well. 

The sky continues beautiful… the pleasure of men with women shall never be sated… no the pleasure of women with men… nor the pleasure from poems;
The domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of houses-- they are not phantasms… they have weight and form and location;
The farms and profits and crops… the markets and wages and government… they also are not phantasms;
The difference between sin and goodness is no apparition;
The earth is not an echo… man and his life and all the things of his life are well-considered. 

You are not thrown to the winds… you gather certainly and safely around yourself, 
Yourself! Yourself! Yourself forever and ever!
