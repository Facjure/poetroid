Some day, when trees have shed their leaves,
  And against the morning’s white
The shivering birds beneath the eaves
  Have sheltered for the night,
We’ll turn our faces southward, love,	        5
  Toward the summer isle
Where bamboos spire the shafted grove
  And wide-mouthed orchids smile.

And we will seek the quiet hill
  Where towers the cotton tree,	        10
And leaps the laughing crystal rill,
  And works the droning bee.
And we will build a lonely nest
  Beside an open glade,
And there forever will we rest,	        15
  O love—O nut-brown maid!
