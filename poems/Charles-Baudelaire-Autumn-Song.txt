They ask me—my crystalline eyes, so acute,
"Odd lover—why am I to you so dear?"
—Be sweet and keep silent, my heart, which is sear,
For all save the rude and untutored brute,

Is resistant its infernal depths to reveal,
And its dissolute motto engraved with fire,
Charmer! whose arms endless sleep inspire!
I abominate passion and wit makes me ill.

So let us love gently. Within his retreat,
Foreboding, Love seeks for his arrows a prey,
I know all the arms of his battle array.

Delirium and loathing— pale Marguerite!
Like me, are you not an autumnal ray,
Finally my so white, my so cold Marguerite!
