"Why are you always weeping, Mom,
  For my little sister fair?
She is now in heaven's kingdom—
  It must be wondrous there!"
"Yes, she is in heaven's glory,
  But in heaven's own land, at last!
There are no butterflies nor flowers—
  Nor meadows of velvet grass!"
"But mother, God's blessed angels
  There, rejoicing sing to Him!"
Forth from the sunset's rosy fires
  Now comes the midnight dim.
The mother wants her baby—
  That she watched from the window wide,
When amid butterflies and blossoms
  She played in the meadow's pride!
