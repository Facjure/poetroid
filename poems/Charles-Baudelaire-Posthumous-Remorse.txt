When you will sleep, my darkling love,
Beneath a black marble-made statuette,
And when you will have nothing for a home or an alcove
But a cavernous den and a damp oubliette.

When the tomb-stone, oppressing your timorous breast,
And your hips drooping sweetly with listless decay,
The pulse and desires of my heart will arrest,
And your feet from pursuing their adventurous way,

Then the grave, that dark friend of my limitless dreams
(For the grave ever reads the poet aright),
Amid those long nights, which no slumber redeems

It will query—"What use to you, incomplete spright
That you never have unfathomed the tears of the dead"?—
Then the worms will gnaw deep at your body, like Dread.
