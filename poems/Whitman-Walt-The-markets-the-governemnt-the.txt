The markets, the government, the workingman's wages… to think what account they are through our night and days; 
To think that the other workingmen will make just as great account of them… yet we make little or no account. 

The vulgar and the refined… what you call sin and what you call goodness… to think how wide a difference;
To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie beyond difference. 

To think how much pleasure there is!
Have you pleasure from looking at the sky? Have you pleasure from poems? 
Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and family?
Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the beautiful maternal cares?

These also flow onward to others… you and I flow onward;
But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.

Your farm and profits and crops… to think how engrossed you are;
To think there will still be farms and profits and crops… yet for you of what avail?
