Today the Distance is superb,
Without bridle, spur or curb,
Let us mount on the back of wine
For Regions fairy and divine!

Let's, like two angels tortured by
Some dark, delirious phantasy,
Pursue the distant mirage drawn
Over the blue crystal of the dawn!

And gently balanced on the wing
Of some obliging whirlwind, we
—In equal rapture reveling—

My sister, side by side will flee,
Without repose, nor truce, where gleams
The golden Paradise of my dreams!
