Strange violin! Do you follow me?
In many foreign cities, far away,
Your lone voice spoke to me like memory.
Do hundreds play you, or does but one play?

Are there in all great cities tempest-tossed
Men who would seek the rivers but for your,

Who, but for you, would be forever lost?
Why drifts you lonely voice always to me?
Why am I the neighbor always
Of those who force to sing your trembling strings?
Life is more heavy— your song says—
Than the vast, heavy burden of all things.
