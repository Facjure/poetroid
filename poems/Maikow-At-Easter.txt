Drawing near the Easter Sunday
With the Easter-greeting kiss;
When I come, remember Dora—
Not alone we suffer this!
Then, as were it for the first time—
Kiss you me and I kiss you;
You with modest eyelids downcast,
I with but ill stifled glee!

*The religious custom of the Easter-greeting kiss prevails throughout Russia.*
