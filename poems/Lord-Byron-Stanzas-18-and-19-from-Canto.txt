 Perfect she was, but as perfection is
      Insipid in this naughty world of ours,
    Where our first parents never learned to kiss
      Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,
    Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss,[b]
      (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),
    Don Jos√©, like a lineal son of Eve,
    Went plucking various fruit without her leave.

    He was a mortal of the careless kind,
      With no great love for learning, or the learned,
    Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
      And never dreamed his lady was concerned;
    The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
      To see a kingdom or a house o'erturned,
    Whispered he had a mistress, some said _two_.
    But for domestic quarrels _one_ will do.
