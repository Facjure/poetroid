Over silent waters
							day descending
											night ascending
floods the gentle glory of the sunset
In a golden greeting
								splendidly to westward
as pale twilight
						trem-
								bles
									into
											Darkness
comes the last light's gracious exhortation
												Lifting up to peace
so when life shall falter
									standing on the shores of the
eternal
god
	May I behold my sunset
Flooding
	over silent waters
