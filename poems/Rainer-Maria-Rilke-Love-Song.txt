When my soul touches yours, a great chord sings!
How should I tune it then to other things?
That some spot in darkness could be found!
That does not vibrate whenever your depths sound.
But everything that touches you and me
Welds us as played strings sound one melody.
Where is the instrument from where the sounds flow?
And whose the master-hand that holds the bow?
Damn! Sweet songâ€”
