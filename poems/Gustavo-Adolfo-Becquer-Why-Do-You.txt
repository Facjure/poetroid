Why do you tell it to me? I know it: she is mutable,
She is arrogant and vain and capricious,
The water will sprout from the sterile rock
Sooner than the feeling from her soul.

I know that in her heart, nest of snakes,
There is not a fiber that belongs to love;
That she is an inanimate statue but
She is so beautiful!
