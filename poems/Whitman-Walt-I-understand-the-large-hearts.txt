I understand the large hearts of heroes, 
The courage of present times and all times;
How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship, and death chasing it up and down the storm, 
How he knuckled tight and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights, 
And chalked in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, We will not desert you;
How he saved the drifting company at last, 
How the lank loose-gowned women looked when boated from the side of their prepared graves, 
How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipped unshaven men;
All this I swallow and it tastes good… I like it well, and it becomes mine,
I am the man… I suffered… I was there.
