The law of the past cannot be eluded,
The law of the present and future cannot be eluded, 
The law of the living cannot be eludedâ€¦ it is eternal, 
The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,
The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded, 
The law of drunkard and informers and mean persons cannot be eluded.
