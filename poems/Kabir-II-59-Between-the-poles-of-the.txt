Between the poles of the conscious and the unconscious, there has the mind made a swing: thereon hang all beings and all worlds, and that swing never ceases its sway. Millions of beings are there: the sun and the moon in their courses are there: millions of ages pass, and the swing goes on. All swing! the sky and the earth and the air and the water; and the Lord Himself taking form: and the sight of this has made Kabir a servant.
