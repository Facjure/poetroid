Great forests, you alarm me like a mighty shrine;
Like organ-tones you roar, and in our hearts of stone,
Where ancient sobs vibrate, halls of endless pain!
The answering echoes of your "De Profundis" moan.

I hate you, Ocean! hate your tumults and your throbs,
My spirit finds them in himself. This bitter glee
Of vanquished mortals, full of insults and of sobs,
I hear it in the mighty laughter of the sea.

Starless night! your loveliness my soul inhales,
Without those starry rays which speak a language known,
For I desire the dark, the naked and the lone.

But even those darknesses themselves to me are veils,
Where liveâ€”and, by the millions beneath my eyelids prance,
Long, long departed Beings with familiar glance.
