I saw a crocus blooming in the park,
I felt a hint of magic in the air,
I heard faint music sighing everywhere,
And so, as all the world, grew softly darkâ€”

I found again the hope that never dies,
And hungrily, with out-flung arms, I came
Once more to you. And when you spoke my name
I read springtime eternal in your eyes!
ROSE PETALS IN THE EARLY RAIN,
FORGOTTEN DREAMS,
AND A TORN SKETCH BOOK!
