The gems that ivories clip,
And chrysoberyls puerile,
Mingling their gleams, beguile
The dole of the black tulip;

The fountain weeps in the old
Garden o'er flowers sad,
Which by the dawn are clad
In amethyst and in gold:

In the boxwood shadow lingers,
In sentimental fÃªtes,
The chevalier, and awaits
The princess whose pale fingers
Are flowers that bring relief
Unto her languorous grief.
