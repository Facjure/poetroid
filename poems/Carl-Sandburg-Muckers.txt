TWENTY men stand watching the muckers.
      Stabbing the sides of the ditch
      Where clay gleams yellow,
      Driving the blades of their shovels
      Deeper and deeper for the new gas mains
      Wiping sweat off their faces
            With red bandanas
The muckers work on .. pausing .. to pull
Their boots out of suckholes where they slosh.

  Of the twenty looking on
Ten murmer, “O, its a hell of a job,”
Ten others, “Jesus, I wish I had the job.”
