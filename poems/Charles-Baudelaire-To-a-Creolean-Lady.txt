In a country perfumed with the sun's embrace,
I knew beneath a dais of purpled palms,
And branches where idleness weeps over one's face,
A Creolean lady of unknown charms.

Her tint, pale and warmâ€”this bewitching bride,
Displays a nobly nurtured bearing,
Courageous and grand like a huntsman, her stride;
A tranquil smile and eyes serene.

If, madam, you'd go to the true land of gain,
By the banks of the verdant Loire or the Seine,
How worthy to garnish some pile of renown.

You'd awake in the calm of some shadowy nest,
A thousand songs in the poet's breast,
That your eyes would inspire far more than your brown.
