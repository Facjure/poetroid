Within this earthen vessel are bowers and groves, and within it is the Creator:
Within this vessel are the seven oceans and the unnumbered stars.
The touchstone and the jewel-appraiser are within;
And within this vessel the Eternal sounds, and the spring wells up.
Kabir says: "Listen to me, my Friend! My beloved Lord is within."
