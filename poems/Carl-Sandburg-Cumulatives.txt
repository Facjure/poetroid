STORMS have beaten on this point of land
And ships gone to wreck here
        and the passers-by remember it
        with talk on the deck at night
        as they near it.

Fists have beaten on the face of this old prize-fighter
And his battles have held the sporting pages
        and on the street they indicate him with their
        right fore-finger as one who once wore
        a championship belt.

A hundred stories have been published and a thousand rumored
About why this tall dark man has divorced two beautiful young women
And married a third who resembles the first two
        and they shake their heads and say, “There he goes,”
        when he passes by in sunny weather or in rain
        along the city streets.
