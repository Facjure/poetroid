Whosoever you are! Out in the evening roam,
Out from your room you know in every part,
And far in the dim distance leave your home,
Whosoever you are.
Lift your eyes which lingering see
The shadows on the foot-worn threshold fall,
Lift thine eyes slowly to the great dark tree
That stands against heaven, solitary, tall,
And you have visioned Life, its meanings rise
Like words that in the silence clearer grow;
As they unfold before your will to know
Gently withdraw your eyesâ€”
