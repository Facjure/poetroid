If they be two, they are two so	        25
  As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fixt foot, makes no show
  To move, but doth if thâ€™ other do.

And though it in the centre sit,
  Yet when the other far doth roam,	        30
It leans and hearkens after it,
  And grows erect as that comes home.

Such wilt thou be to me, who must,
  Like the other foot, obliquely run;
Thy firmness makes my circles just,	        35
  And makes me end where I begun.
