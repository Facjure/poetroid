As when at times there breaks through bare branches
A morning vibrant with the breath of spring,
About this poet-head a rare splendor
Transforms it almost to a mortal thing.

There is as yet no shadow in his glance,
Too cool his temples for the laurel's glow;
But later over those marble brows, perchance,
A rose-garden with tall bushes will grow,

And single petals one by one will fall
Over the still mouth and break its silent thrall,
â€”The mouth that trembles with a dawning smile
As though a song were rising there the while.
