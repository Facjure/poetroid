Great is Justice;
Justice is not settled by legislators and laws… it is in the soul, 
It cannot be varied by statues any more than love or pride or the attraction of gravity can, 
It is immutable… it does not depend on majorities… majorities or what not come at last before the same passionless and exact tribunal.
