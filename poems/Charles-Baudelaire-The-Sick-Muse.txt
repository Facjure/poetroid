Finally—my poor Muse—what ails you now?
Your eyes are dimmed with the visions of Night,
And silent and cold— I perceive on your brow
In their turns— Despair and Madness alight.

A succubus green, or a hobgoblin red,
Has it poured over your Horror and Love from its urn?
Or the Nightmare with masterful bearing has led
You to drown in the depths of some magic Minturne?

I wish, as the health-giving fragrance I cull,
That your breast with strong thoughts could forever be full,
And that rhythmically flowing— your Christian blood

Could resemble the olden-time metrical-flood,
Where each in his turn reigned the father of Rhymes
Phoebus—and Pan, lord of Harvest-times.
