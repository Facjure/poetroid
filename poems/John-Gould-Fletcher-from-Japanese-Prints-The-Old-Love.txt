Beware, for the dying vine can hold
The strongest oak.
Only by cutting at the root
Can love be altered.
Late in the night
A rosy glimmer yet defies the darkness.
But the evening is growing late,
The blinds are being lowered;
She who held your heart and charmed you
Is only a rosy glimmer of flame remembered.
