   ON the street
Slung on his shoulder is a handle half way across,
Tied in a big knot on the scoop of cast iron
Are the overalls faded from sun and rain in the ditches;
Spatter of dry clay sticking yellow on his left sleeve
   And a flimsy shirt open at the throat,
   I know him for a shovel man,
   A dago working for a dollar six bits a day
And a dark-eyed woman in the old country dreams of him for one of the worldâ€™s ready men with a pair of fresh lips and a kiss better than all the wild grapes that ever grew in Tuscany.
