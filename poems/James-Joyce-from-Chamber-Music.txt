     All day I hear the noise of waters
     Making moan,
     Sad as the sea-bird is when, going
     Forth alone,
     He hears the winds cry to the water's
     Monotone.
     The grey winds, the cold winds are blowing
     Where I go.
     I hear the noise of many waters
     Far below.
     All day, all night, I hear them flowing
     To and fro.
