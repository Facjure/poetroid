When psalm sings instead of the singer,
When the script preaches instead of the preacher, 
When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that carved the supporting desk, 
When the sacred vessels or the bits of the eucharist, or the lath an plaits, procreate as effectually as the young silversmiths or baker, or masons in their overalls, 
When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and child convince, 
When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the nightwatchman's daughter, 
When the warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite and are my friendly companions, 
I intend to reach them my hand and make as much of them as I do of men and women.
