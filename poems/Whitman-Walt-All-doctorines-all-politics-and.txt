All doctrines, all politics and civilization exurge from you, 
All sculpture and monuments and anything inscribed anywhere are tallied in you, 
The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records reach is in you this hour-- and myths and tales the same; 
If you were not breathing and walking here where would they all be?
The most renowned poems would be ashesâ€¦ orations and plays would be vacuums.
