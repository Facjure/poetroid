Peace is always beautiful, 
The myth of heaven indicates peace and night. 

The myth of heaven indicates the soul;
The soul is always beautiful… it appears more or it appears less… it comes or lags behind,
It comes from its embowered garden and looks pleasantly on itself and enclosed the world;
Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect and clean the womb cohering, 
The head wellgrown and proportioned and plumb, and the bowels and joints proportioned and plumb. 

The soul is always beautiful, 
The universe is duly in order… every thing is in its place, 
What is arrived is in its place, and what waits is in its place;
The twisted skull waits… the watery or rotten blood waits,
The child of the glutton or venereal waits long, and the child of the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself wait long, 
The sleepers that lived and died wait… the far advanced are to go on in their turns, and the far behind are to go on in their turns, 
The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite… they unite now.
