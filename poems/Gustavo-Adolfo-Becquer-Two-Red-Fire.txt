Two red fire flames
That hug the same trunk
They get close and, kissing each other,
They form a single flame.

Two notes that of the lute
A hand plays at the same time,
And in the space they met each other
And harmonious they hug each other.

Two waves that come together
To die on a lonely beach
And while breaking they feel crown
With a silver pride.

Two shreds of vapor
That get up from the lake
And, when joining there in the sky,
They form a white cloud.

Two ideas that sprout at the same time,
Two kisses that at the same time explode,
Two echoes that join together
This is our two souls.
