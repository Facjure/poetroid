I wander all night in my vision, 
Stepping with light feet… swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping, 
Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers; 
Wandering and confused… lost to myself… ill-assorted… contradictory,
Pausing and gazing and bending and stopping. 

How solemn they look there, stretched and still;
How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.
