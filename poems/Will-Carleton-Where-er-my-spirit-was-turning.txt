Where'er my spirit was turning,
Lived that mysterious yearning!
When in the old country school-house I conned
Legends of life in the broad world beyond—
When in the trim hamlet-college I cast
Wondering glances at days that were past—
Ever I longed for the walls and the streets,
And the rich conflict that energy meets!...
