  Boy, won't you light me a lamp. "But dear master, there's light in the sky yet.
	Don't waste your oil and the wick. Don't close the shutters so soon.
	Only the houses are blocking the sun there, it's not yet the mountains.
	Until the curfew shall ring, full half an hour must pass."
	Wretched young fellow, be gone and obey me! My loved one is coming.
	Lamplight, console me till then, harbinger warm of the night.
