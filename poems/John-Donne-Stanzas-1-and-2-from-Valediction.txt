AS virtuous men pass mildly away,
  And whisper to their souls to go;
While some of their sad friends do say,
  Now his breath goes, and some say, No;

So let us melt, and make no noise,	        5
  No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;
â€™Twere profanation of our joys
  To tell the laity our love.
