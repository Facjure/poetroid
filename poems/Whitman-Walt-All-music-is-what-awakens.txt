All music is what awakens from you when you are reminded by the instruments, 
It is not the violins and the cornets… it is not the oboe nor the beating drums-- nor the notes of the baritone singer singing his sweet romans… nor those of the men's chorus, nor those of the women's chorus, 
It is nearer and farther than they.
