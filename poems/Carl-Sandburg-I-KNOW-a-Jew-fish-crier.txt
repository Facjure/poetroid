I KNOW a Jew fish crier down on Maxwell Street with a voice like a north wind blowing over corn stubble in January.	
He dangles herring before prospective customers evincing a joy identical with that of Pavlowa dancing.	
His face is that of a man terribly glad to be selling fish, terribly glad that God made fish, and customers to whom he may call his wares, from a pushcart.
