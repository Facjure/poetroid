Love we (my Lesbia!) and live we our day,
While all stern sayings crabbed sages say,
At one penny's value let us price and prize!
The Suns can westward sink again to rise

But we, extinguished once our tiny light,
Perforce shall slumber through one lasting night!
Kiss me a thousand times, then hundred more,
Then thousand others, then a new five-score,
Still other thousand other hundred store.

Last when the sums to many thousands grow,
The tale let's trouble till no more we know,
Nor envious wight despiteful shall seperate us
Knowing how many kisses have been kissed between us.
