She has hurt me hiding in the shadows,
Sealing her betrayal with a kiss.
She surrounded my neck with her arms and
She left my heart in cold blood behind my back.

And she follows her road,
Happy, smiling, dauntless, and why?
Because it doesn't sprout blood from the wound,
Because the died is standing up.
