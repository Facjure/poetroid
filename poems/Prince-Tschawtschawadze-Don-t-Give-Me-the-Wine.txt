Don't give me the wine!
                              I am drunk of my love,
With the force of my passion for you!
Don't give me the wine!
                              Or my tongue will betray
All the love no one dreamed until now;
For wine will reveal all I hid in my breast,
All the bitter hot tears that were mine,
My thirst, without hope, for a future so blest—
I am drunk of my love,—don't give me the wine!
You promise me roses now, if I will drink
But one drop of the wine;—if you please
Give only one breath from the rose of your lips!
And death's cup I will drain to the lees.
All passions are raging at once in my blood,
Know my frenzy! Love's madness is mine.
You seem for my suffering only to wish—
I am drunk of my love!
                              Don't give me the wine!
