How beauteous the sun as it rises supreme,
Like an explosion that greets us from above,
Happy is he that can hail with love,
Its decline, more glorious far, than a dream.

I saw flower, furrow, and brook.... I recall
How they swooned like a tremulous heart beneath the sun,
Let us haste to the sky-line, it's late, let us run,
At least to catch one slanting ray before it falls.

But the god, who eludes me, I chase all in vain,
The night, irresistible, plants its domain,
Black mists and vague shivers of death it forebodes;

While an odor of graves through the darkness spreads,
And on the swamp's margin, my timid foot treads
Upon slimy snails, and on unseen toads.
