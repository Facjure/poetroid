Love or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;
   Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;
But making money, slowly first, then quicker,
   And adding still a little through each cross
(Which will come over things), beats love or liquor,
   The gamester's counter, or the statesman's dross.
O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,
Which makes bank credit like a bank of vapor.
