Will you seek afar off? You surely come back at last, 
In things best known to you finding the best or as good as the best, 
In folks nearest to you finding also the sweetest and strongest and lovingest, 
Happiness not in another place, but this place… not for another hour, but this hour, 
Man in the first you see or touch… always in your friend or brother or neighbor… Woman in your mother or lover in wife,
And all else thus far known giving place to men and women.
