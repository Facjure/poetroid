The sun is enveloped in crape! like it,
Moon of my Life! wrap yourself up in shade;
At will, smoke or slumber, be silent, be staid,
And dive deep down in Dispassion's dark pit.

I cherish you so! But if it's your mood,
Like a star that from out its penumbra appears
To float in the regions where madness careers,
Fair dagger! burst forth from your sheath! It's good.

Yes, light up your eyes at the Fire of Renown!
Or kindle desire by the looks of some clown!
Your All is my joy, whether dull or aflame!

Just be what you will, black night, dawn divine,
There is not a nerve in my trembling frame
But cries, "I adore you, Beelzebub mine!"
