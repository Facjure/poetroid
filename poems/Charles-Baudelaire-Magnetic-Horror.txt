"Beneath this sky, so livid and strange,
Tormented like your destiny,
What thoughts within your spirit range
Themselves?— libertine reply."

—With vain desires, for ever torn
Towards the uncertain, and the vast,
And all the same, like Ovid—I'll not mourn—
Who from his Roman Heaven was cast.

Heavens, turbulent as the streams,
In you I mirror forth my pride!
Your clouds, which clad in mourning, glide,

Are the hearses of my dreams,
And in your illusion lies the hell,
Wherein my heart delights to dwell.
