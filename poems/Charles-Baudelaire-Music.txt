Usually Music possesses me like the seas!
To my planet pale,
Bneath a ceiling of mist, in the lofty breeze,
I set my sail.

With inflated lungs and expanded chest,
Like to a sail,
On the backs of the heaped-up billows I rest—
Which the shadows veil—

I feel all the anguish within me arise
Of a ship in distress;
The tempest, the rain, beneath the lowering skies,

My body caress;
At times, the calm pool or the mirror clear
Of my despair!
