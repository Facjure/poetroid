Sometimes the mist overhangs my path,
And blackening clouds about me cling;
But, I have a magic way
To turn the gloom to cheerful dayâ€”
I softly sing.
And if the way grows darker still,
Shadowed by Sorrow's somber wing,
With glad defiance in my throat,
I pierce the darkness with a note,
And sing, and sing.
I brood not over the broken past,
Nor dread whatever time may bring;
No nights are dark, no days are long,
While in my heart there swells a song,
And I can sing.
