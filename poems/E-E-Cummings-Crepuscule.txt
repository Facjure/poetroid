I will wade out
						till my thighs are steeped in burn-
ing flowers
I will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air
										Alive
												with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
									in the sleeping curves of my
body
Shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of sea-girls
										Will I complete the mystery
of my flesh
I will rise
			After a thousand years
lipping
flowers
		And set my teeth in the silver of the moon
