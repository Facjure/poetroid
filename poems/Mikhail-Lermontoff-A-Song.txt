Dry leaf trembling on the branches
  Before the blast,
Poor heart quaking in the bosom
  For regret you hast;
What matter if the wind then,
  Withered leaf from blooming linden
Should scatter wide?
  Would for this the twig or branches
    Have wailing sighed?
And should the lad his fate upbraid,
  Although he ignominious fadeâ€”
And in an alien country die?
  Will for him the beauteous maid
    Complaining cry?
