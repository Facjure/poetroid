It's Autumn! Our garden stands
  Flowerless and bare,
Dizzy whirling yellow leaves
  Fill the wind swept air.
But the distant mountain ash
  In the vale below,
With our favorite berries red
  Now begins to glow.
While with rapture and with pain
  Throbbing in my breast,
Pressing hot your hands in mine,
  Silent, unexpressed—
Fondly gazing in your eyes,
  Through my tears I see—
That I can never tell you
  How dear to me are you!
