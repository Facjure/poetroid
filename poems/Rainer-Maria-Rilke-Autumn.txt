The leaves fall, fall as from far,
Like distant gardens withered in the heavens;
They fall with slow and lingering descent.

And in the nights the heavy Earth, too, falls
From out the stars into the Solitude.

All fall. This hand of mine must fall
And! the other one:â€”it is the law.
But there is One who holds this falling
Infinitely softly in His hands.
