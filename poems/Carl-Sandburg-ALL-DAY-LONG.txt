ALL day long in fog and wind,
The waves have flung their beating crests
Against the palisades of adamant.
     My boy, he went to sea, long and long ago,
     Curls of brown were slipping underneath his cap,
     He looked at me from blue and steely eyes;
     Natty, straight and true, he stepped away,
     My boy, he went to sea.
All day long in fog and wind,
The waves have flung their beating crests
Against the palisades of adamant.
