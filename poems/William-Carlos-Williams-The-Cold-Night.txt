It is cold. The white moon
is up among her scattered stars—
like the bare thighs of
the Police Seargent’s wife—among
her five children....
No answer. Pale shadows lie upon
the frosted grass. One answer:
It is midnight, it is still
and it is cold...!
White thighs of the sky! a
new answer out of the depths of
my male belly: In April....
In April I shall see again—In April!
the round and perfect thighs
of the Police Sergent’s wife
perfect still after many babies.
Oya!
