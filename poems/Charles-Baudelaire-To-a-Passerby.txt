Around me thundered the deafening noise of the street,
In mourning apparel, portraying majestic distress,
With queenly fingers, just lifting the hem of her dress,
A stately woman passed by with hurrying feet.

Agile and noble, with limbs of perfect poise,
Damn, how I drank, thrilled through like a Being insane,
In her look, a dark sky, from where springs forth the hurricane,
There lay but the sweetness that charms, and the joy that destroys.

A flashâ€”then the night.... loveliness fugitive!
Whose glance has so suddenly caused me again to live,
Will I not see you again until this life is over!

Elsewhere, far away ... too late, perhaps never more,
For I know not where you fly, nor you, where I go,
Soul that I would have loved, and that you know!
