You were the hurricane and I the high tower
That challenges its power:
You had to smash or to fall
It could not be!

You were the ocean and I the strong
Rock that, straight, awaits its sway:
You had to break yourself or to pull me up
It could not be!

Beautiful you, I proud: accustomed
One to roll, the other one not to giving up:
Narrow the way, unavoidable the crash
It could not be!
