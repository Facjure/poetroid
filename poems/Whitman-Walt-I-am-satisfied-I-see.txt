I am satisfiedâ€¦ I see, dance, laugh, sing;
As God comes a loving bedfellow and sleeps at my side all night and close on the peep of the day, 
And leaves for me baskets covered with white towels bulging the house with their plenty, 
Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes, 
That they turn from gazing after and down the road, 
And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent, 
Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the contents of two, and which is ahead?
