Weep every Venus, and all Cupids wail,
And men whose gentler spirits still prevail.
Dead is the Sparrow of my girl, the joy,
Sparrow, my sweeting's most delicious toy,

Whom loved she dearer than her very eyes;
For he was honeyed-pet and anywise
Knew her, as even she her mother knew;
Ne'er from her bosom's harborage he flew
But around her hopping here, there, everywhere,

Piped he to none but her his lady fair.
Now must he wander o'er the darkling way
Thither, whence life-return the Fates deny.
But ah! beshrew you, evil Shadows lowering
In Orcus ever loveliest things devouring:

Who bore so pretty a Sparrow from her taken.
(Oh hapless birdie and Oh deed of bane!)
Now by your wanton work my girl appears
With turgid eyelids tinted rose by tears.
