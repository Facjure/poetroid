A long while I lived beneath vast porticoes,
While the ocean-suns bathed with a thousand fires,
And which with their great and majestic spires,
At eventide looked like basaltic grottoes.

The billows, in rolling picturesque the skies,
And mingled, in solemn and mystical strain,
The all-mighty chords of their luscious refrain
With the sunset's colors reflected in my eyes.

It is there that I lived in exalted calm,
In the midst of the azure, the splendor, the waves,
While pregnant with perfumes, naked slaves

Refreshed my forehead with branches of palm,
Whose gentle and only care was to know
The secret that caused me to languish so.
