To think of time… to think through the retrospection, 
To think of today… and the ages continued henceforward.
Have you guessed you yourself would not continue? Have you dreaded those earth-beetles?
Have you feared the future would be nothing to you?

Is today nothing? Is the beginningless past nothing?
If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing.

To think that the sun rose in the east… that men and women were flexible and real and alive… that everything was real and alive;
To think that you and I did not see feel think nor bear our part, 
To think that we are now here and bear our part.
