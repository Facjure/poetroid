Where snails abound in a juicy soil,
I will dig for myself a fathomless grave,
Where at leisure my ancient bones I can coil,
And sleep—quite forgotten—like a shark beneath the wave.

I hate every tomb, I abominate wills,
And rather than tears from the world to implore,
I would ask of the crows with their vampire bills
To devour every bit of my carcass impure.

Worms, without eyes, without ears, black friends!
To you a defunct-one, rejoicing, descends,
Enlivened Philosophers—offspring of Dung!

Without any qualms, over my wreckage spread,
And tell if some torment there still can be wrung
For this soulless old frame that is dead amidst the dead!
