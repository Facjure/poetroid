I AM the wind that wavers,
  You are the certain land;
I am the shadow that passes
  Over the sand.

I am the leaf that quivers,	        5
  You the unshaken tree;
You are the stars that are steadfast,
  I am the sea.

You are the light eternalâ€”
  Like a torch I shall die;	        10
You are the surge of deep music,
  I but a cry!
