The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed, 
They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as they lie unclothed;
The Asiatic and African are hand in hand… the European and American are hand in hand, 
Learn and unlearned are hand in hand… and male and female are hand in hand;
The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover… they press close without lust… his lips press her neck,
The father holds his grown or ingrown son in his arms with measureless love, 
The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter, 
The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man… friend is inarmed by friend, 
The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar… the wronged is made right, 
The call of the slave is one with the master's call… and the master salutes the slave,
The felon steps forth from the prison… the insane becomes sane… the suffering of sick persons is relieved, 
The sweatings and fevers stop… the throat that was unsound is sound… the lungs of consumptive are resumed… the poor distressed head is free, 
The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother than ever, 
Stiflings and passages open… the paralyzed become supple, 
The swelled and convulsed and congested awake to themselves in condition, 
They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the night and awake.
