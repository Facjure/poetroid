How sweet and bitter, on a winter night,
Beside the palpitating fire to list,
As, slowly, distant memories alight,
To sounds of chimes that sing across the mist.

How happy is that bell with hearty throat,
Which neither age nor time can ever defeat,
Which faithfully uplifts its pious note,
Like a soldier aged on his beat.

For me, my soul is cracked, and amid her cares,
Would often fill with her songs the midnight airs
And often it chances that her feeble moan

Is like the wounded warrior's fainting groan,
Who by a lake of blood, beneath bodies slain,
In anguish falls, and never moves again.
