LEGS hold a torso away from the earth.	
And a regular high poem of legs is here.	
Powers of bone and cord raise a belly and lungs	
Out of ooze and over the loam where eyes look and ears hear	
And arms have a chance to hammer and shoot and run motors.	        
   You make us	
   Proud of our legs, old man.	
 
And you left off the head here,	
The skull found always crumbling neighbor of the ankles.
